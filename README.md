# CuteKorean Downloader

An easy-to-use /r/CuteKorean subReddit album download bot. It will automatically download all latest upload, or base on your preference, only download selected ones.

**Python3** Required. For beginner, please read "[Python Installation Guide](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/installation/)" first. 

## How to run the bot 

There are two files available, **cqrssdl.py** and **crqssdl_ala.py**.

**cqrssdl.py** only downloads selected models. You can edit `<models_name>` list to add or remove selections. 

**cqrssdl.py** downloads all the latest albums. 

### Run command

Please execute the following in your terminal: 
>python cqrssdl.py
>python cqrssdl_ala.py

## How to automate the download

You can automate this bot with Windows Task Scheduler, Linux Cron, and Mac Crontab. I'm unable to find a good guide on this. Please google it yourself in the mean time. 

## Note

This is only the prototype. More feature, including GUI is planned. Please feel free to make changes to the bot.
